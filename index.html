                         A group of sci&shy;entists is launching what they say will be a new paci&shy;fist nation-state in space.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                         Asgardia &laquo;will become a place in orbit which is truly 'no man's land',&raquo; its website says.
                         The new &laquo;nation&raquo; aims to launch its first sa&shy;tellite late next year and
                          hopes to one day be recog&shy;nised by the UN. But some experts have cast
                          doubt on the viabi&shy;lity of the plan, given inter&shy;national law prohi&shy;bits
                          national sove&shy;reignty claims in outer space.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                         &laquo;Citizens&raquo; of Asgardia, who will be scruti&shy;nised before admission, will
                         even&shy;tually obtain passports, says Lena de Winne, a senior member of the project
                          team who worked for the Euro&shy;pean Space Agency for 15 years.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                         In essence, an object sit&shy;ting in a &laquo;quiet&raquo; region of space can be
                         held there if it is sur&shy;rounded by very high-intensity sound waves. As the
                         pat&shy;tern of that boun&shy;dary shifts, the object can be moved around.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                         &laquo;Clearly it's diffi&shy;cult to wrap your head around
                         the concept [of] how can you be a citi&shy;zen of some&shy;thing
                         you cannot put your foot on,&raquo; she told the BBC.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                         &laquo;But I'm a citi&shy;zen of the Nether&shy;lands and I'm now in Paris…
                         There is nothing unusual about it if you are a cit&shy;izen of a land
                         where you don't live and where you don't go.&raquo;
                     </p>
                     <p>
                         The project is being directed by the Vienna-based Aero&shy;space Inter&shy;national
                         Research Center, a private company founded by Russian scien&shy;tist and
                         business&shy;man Dr Igor Ashurbeiyli.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                         He joked to repor&shy;ters in Paris at an event announ&shy;cing the project
                         that he would not be sur&shy;prised if the media labelled him a
                         &laquo;crazy Russian rocket scien&shy;tist&raquo; talking &laquo;utter nonsense&raquo;.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                         Its website says the new nation, the name of which derives from a city in the sky
                         in Norse mythology, &laquo;will offer an indepen&shy;dent plat&shy;form free from
                         the cons&shy;traint of a land-based country's laws&raquo;. The group says it will
                         open up new oppor&shy;tuni&shy;ties in space for commerce, science and
                         &laquo;peoples of all countries on earth&raquo;.
                     </p>

                         Competitions are being held to decide a nati&shy;onal anthem and flag design.
                         Professor Sa'id Mosteshar, director of the London Insti&shy;tute of Space Policy
                         and Law, cast doubt on the idea that Asgardia would be re&shy;cogni&shy;sed
                         under inter&shy;national law.
                     </p>
                 </div>
                 <p>
                     &laquo;The Outer Space Treaty… accep&shy;ted by every&shy;body says very clearly
                     that no part of outer space can be appro&shy;pria&shy;ted by any state,&raquo; he said.
                     Given Asgardia will not be asso&shy;ciated with a self-gover&shy;ning terri&shy;tory,
                     with its 'citizens' rema&shy;ining on earth, its pros&shy;pects for
                     recog&shy;nition are slim, he added.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                     The project is being funded per&shy;sonally by Dr Ashur&shy;beiyli at present,
                     but the group have announ&shy;ced they will seek crowd&shy;funding. Already
                     more than 50,000 people have applied to 'join' the state online.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                     This crowd&shy;funding aspect suggests the group's founders &laquo;don't have any real
                     credible business plan&raquo;, Professor Mosteshar said. On the legal aspects,
                     Dr Ashurbeiyli says he wants to create a&laquo;"new judicial reality in space&raquo;.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                     &laquo;The project is crea&shy;ting a new frame&shy;work for owner&shy;ship and
                     nation&shy;hood in space, which will adapt current outer space laws gover&shy;ning
                     res&shy;ponsi&shy;bility, private owner&shy;ship and enter&shy;prise so they are
                     fit for purpose in the new era of space explo&shy;ration,&raquo; a state&shy;ment said.
